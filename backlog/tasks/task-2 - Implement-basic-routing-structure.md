## Description

Set up SvelteKit routes for diary and static pages to support the main site navigation structure

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Route /diary exists and loads properly
- [x] Routes for static pages (/uses /now /about /open) exist
- [x] Clean URL structure without language prefix for English
- [x] Basic page structure with proper SvelteKit conventions

## Implementation Plan

1. Create /diary route with basic page structure
2. Create static page routes (/uses, /now, /about, /open)
3. Use modern Svelte 5 syntax with runes
4. Ensure proper SvelteKit conventions
5. Test all routes load correctly

## Implementation Notes

**Approach Taken:**
- Created comprehensive routing structure using SvelteKit file-based routing conventions
- Implemented proper SvelteKit data loading patterns with +page.ts files for SSR and performance
- Used modern Svelte 5 syntax with PageProps types and proper component rendering
- Integrated with task-1 content loading system for diary functionality
- Used Rick Rubin's philosophy as inspiration for content tone and messaging
- Fixed MDsveX configuration to properly handle .md file extensions

**Features Implemented:**
- `/` - Homepage with navigation cards and Rick Rubin quote
- `/diary` - Diary listing with server-side data loading and streaming
- `/diary/[slug]` - Individual diary entries with SSR and proper 404 handling
- `/uses` - Tools and software showcase page
- `/now` - Current status and projects page with philosophy quotes
- `/about` - Personal story from success to rock bottom and rebuild
- `/open` - Transparent metrics and shocking personal facts page

**Technical Decisions:**
- Used SvelteKit load functions in +page.ts files for proper SSR and data streaming
- Implemented modern Svelte 5 PageProps types for cleaner TypeScript integration
- Used proper error handling with SvelteKit's error() helper for 404 pages
- Applied modern Svelte 5 component rendering with {@const} pattern (no deprecated svelte:component)
- Eliminated client-side data fetching for better performance and SEO
- Applied TailwindCSS v4 for consistent styling across all pages
- Configured MDsveX to handle .md extensions for content processing
- Used semantic HTML structure and proper accessibility attributes
