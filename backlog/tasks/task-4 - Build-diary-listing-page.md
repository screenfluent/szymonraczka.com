## Description

Create /diary page showing chronological entries with tags to serve as the main content discovery page

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Page displays entries in chronological order (newest first)
- [x] Shows title date and excerpt for each entry
- [x] Tag filtering works (personal howtos glossary)
- [x] Intro header matches PRD vision (Rick Rubin inspired)
- [x] Responsive design with clean layout

## Implementation Notes

**What Actually Happened:**
This task was completed as part of task-2 (Implement basic routing structure) implementation. During the routing implementation, it became clear that creating meaningful routes required implementing the actual diary listing functionality rather than placeholder pages.

**Approach Taken:**
- Diary listing page was built during task-2 as part of comprehensive routing implementation
- Used SvelteKit load functions (+page.ts) for proper SSR and data streaming  
- Integrated with task-1 content loading system for diary entry retrieval
- Applied modern Svelte 5 patterns with PageProps types

**Features Implemented:**
- Chronological display of diary entries (newest first) with proper date formatting
- Title, date, and excerpt display for each entry with responsive layout
- Tag display for each entry (visual representation implemented)
- Rick Rubin inspired header: "Uncensored snapshots of my life and rebuild"
- Clean, responsive design using TailwindCSS v4
- Loading states and error handling via SvelteKit patterns

**Tag Filtering Implementation:**
- Added URL-based tag filtering via clean top-level URLs (/{tag})
- Tag filter UI with "All" option and individual tag pills
- Clickable tags on diary entries that link to filtered views
- Visual indication of currently selected tag
- Server-side filtering using existing content system functions

**Technical Implementation:**
- File: src/routes/diary/+page.ts (load function)
- File: src/routes/diary/+page.svelte (listing component)
- Uses: loadDiaryEntries() from task-1 content system
- Pattern: Server-side data loading with client-side streaming

**Why This Happened:**
Task boundaries evolved during implementation as it made more sense to build complete, functional features rather than artificial separation between "routing" and "content display". This is normal project evolution and reflects practical development realities.

**Final Implementation with Top-Level Tag URLs:**
- Implemented SvelteKit parameter matcher to resolve route conflicts
- Created src/params/tag.ts matcher that validates if URL segment is a valid tag
- Moved tag routes to top-level /src/routes/[tag=tag]/ for clean URLs
- Tag filtering now uses intuitive top-level URLs (e.g., /devlog, /howtos, /personal)
- Updated all tag links throughout the site to use clean top-level format
- Updated PRD.md to reflect clean URL approach for consistency

**Final URL Structure:**
- Main diary listing: /diary (shows all entries with tag filter UI)
- Tag categories: /{tag} (e.g., /devlog, /howtos - top-level clean URLs)
- Individual entries: /diary/{slug} (existing individual diary entry routes)
- Router automatically distinguishes between valid tags and other routes using matcher
- Parameter matcher ensures only existing tags resolve, others fall through to 404

**Technical Implementation:**
- File: src/params/tag.ts (parameter matcher for tag validation)
- File: src/routes/[tag=tag]/+page.ts (tag filtering load function at top level)
- File: src/routes/[tag=tag]/+page.svelte (tag-specific listing view at top level)
- File: src/routes/diary/+page.ts (simplified to show all entries only)
- File: src/routes/diary/+page.svelte (updated tag links to top-level URLs)
- File: PRD.md (updated to reflect clean URL structure)

**Why This Approach:**
Top-level tag URLs provide the cleanest, most intuitive user experience while leveraging SvelteKit's parameter matcher system for robust route validation. This creates clear semantic URLs where tags act as top-level categories.
