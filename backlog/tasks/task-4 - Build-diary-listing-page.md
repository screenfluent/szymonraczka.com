## Description

Create /diary page showing chronological entries with tags to serve as the main content discovery page

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Page displays entries in chronological order (newest first)
- [x] Shows title date and excerpt for each entry
- [ ] Tag filtering works (personal howtos glossary) - Note: Display implemented, filtering functionality not yet added
- [x] Intro header matches PRD vision (Rick Rubin inspired)
- [x] Responsive design with clean layout

## Implementation Notes

**What Actually Happened:**
This task was completed as part of task-2 (Implement basic routing structure) implementation. During the routing implementation, it became clear that creating meaningful routes required implementing the actual diary listing functionality rather than placeholder pages.

**Approach Taken:**
- Diary listing page was built during task-2 as part of comprehensive routing implementation
- Used SvelteKit load functions (+page.ts) for proper SSR and data streaming  
- Integrated with task-1 content loading system for diary entry retrieval
- Applied modern Svelte 5 patterns with PageProps types

**Features Implemented:**
- Chronological display of diary entries (newest first) with proper date formatting
- Title, date, and excerpt display for each entry with responsive layout
- Tag display for each entry (visual representation implemented)
- Rick Rubin inspired header: "Uncensored snapshots of my life and rebuild"
- Clean, responsive design using TailwindCSS v4
- Loading states and error handling via SvelteKit patterns

**Outstanding Work:**
- Tag filtering functionality (display is implemented, but click-to-filter is not)
- This could be addressed in a future task for enhanced UX

**Technical Implementation:**
- File: src/routes/diary/+page.ts (load function)
- File: src/routes/diary/+page.svelte (listing component)
- Uses: loadDiaryEntries() from task-1 content system
- Pattern: Server-side data loading with client-side streaming

**Why This Happened:**
Task boundaries evolved during implementation as it made more sense to build complete, functional features rather than artificial separation between "routing" and "content display". This is normal project evolution and reflects practical development realities.
