			<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Who I Am</h2>
			<p class="mb-4">
				I'm Szymon Raczka, a 44-year-old solo indie developer with ADHD. I believe in radical 
				transparency and honest sharing of the entrepreneurial journey - the good, the bad, 
				and everything in between.

			<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">The Journey</h2>
			
			<h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-3">The Peak</h3>
			<p class="mb-4">
				I experienced significant success in TV and online content, including achieving 
				165 million YouTube views. For a moment, it felt like I had made it.
			</p>

			<h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-3">The Fall</h3>
			<p class="mb-4">
				But success can be fragile. Poor decisions, including hiring mistakes after the 
				YouTube success, led to a dramatic fall. I hit rock bottom - dealing with debt, 
				depression, and the weight of failure.
			</p>

			<h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-3">The Rebuild</h3>
			<p class="mb-4">
				Now I'm rebuilding, inspired by Rick Rubin's philosophy of honest creation. 
				This site is part of that process - sharing raw thoughts, technical learnings, 
				and the reality of starting over.
			</p>

		<section class="mb-8">
			<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">What I Share</h2>
			<ul class="space-y-3">
				<li>
					<strong>Personal Reflections:</strong> Raw thoughts on burnout, perfectionism, 
					happiness found in simple things (like working from my car).
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Tech for Non-Tech Founders:</strong> Practical explanations of concepts 
					that used to melt my brain (like package.json), now explained in simple terms.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Open Metrics:</strong> Transparent sharing of debts, future income projections, 
					and other "shocking" personal facts.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>The Learning Journey:</strong> How I went from confused to clarity in 
					various technical and business areas.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section class="mb-8">
			<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Why I Share</h2>
			<p class="mb-4">
				Too many entrepreneurial stories are polished success narratives. I want to share 
				the messy, honest reality - the failures, the confusion, the small victories, 
				and the ongoing struggle to build something meaningful.
			</p>
			<p class="mb-4">
				If my transparency can help even one indie hacker or non-tech founder feel less 
				alone in their journey, then it's worth it.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section class="mb-8">
			<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Languages & Audience</h2>
			<p class="mb-4">
				I write primarily in English for global reach, but also share content in Polish 
				for personal expression. Both languages serve different purposes in my honest sharing.
