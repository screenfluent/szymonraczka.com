# Understanding package.json

Remember when I said package.json used to melt my brain? Let me explain it in simple terms.

## What is package.json?

Think of it like a restaurant's recipe book and supplier list combined:

- **Recipe book**: Lists what your app needs to work (dependencies)
- **Supplier list**: Shows where to get those ingredients (npm registry)
- **Instructions**: Tells the kitchen staff how to prepare dishes (scripts)

## The Breakthrough Moment

The moment it clicked for me was realizing it's just a manifest. Like a shopping list for your code.

```json
{
	"name": "my-restaurant",
	"dependencies": {
		"flour": "^2.0.0",
		"sugar": "^1.5.0"
	},
	"scripts": {
		"bake-bread": "mix flour water yeast",
		"make-dessert": "mix sugar flour eggs"
	}
}
```

## For Non-Tech Founders

If you're starting with code/AI assistance:

1. Don't panic when you see package.json
2. It's just a list of what your app needs
3. The computer handles downloading everything
4. Focus on the "scripts" section - those are commands you can run

That's it. No brain melting required.

From confused to clarity - that's the journey.
