# Building the Content System

This is my first diary entry in the new system. Following Rick Rubin's philosophy: "This is something that I am making for myself for now."

## The Journey So Far

I've been building this personal site to share raw thoughts about:

- The rebuild after hitting rock bottom
- Tech learnings that confused me (like when package.json used to melt my brain)
- Honest reflections on success, failure, and everything in between

## Technical Notes

Today I built the content loading system. The approach:

1. Markdown files with frontmatter in `/content/{lang}/diary/`
2. YYYYMMDDHHMM filename prefixes for chronological ordering
3. Tag-based filtering for different content types

It's simple, but it works. That's the point - honest tools for honest sharing.

## What's Next

Building out the diary listing page and individual entry rendering. The goal is to make publishing these raw thoughts as frictionless as possible.

No blocks. Just honest sharing of where I am at.
